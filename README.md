# carrier.py
carrier.py is a Python package/module that's used to save time when programming, it helps with functions such as 24 and 12 hour time, Discord webhooks, etc. These are all mainly things that I've been annoyed by because I keep forgetting the code and so I've just bundle it up into carrier.py
